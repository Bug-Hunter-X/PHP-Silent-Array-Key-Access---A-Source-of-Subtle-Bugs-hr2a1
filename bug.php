In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys.  If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error, but instead return null. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in nested arrays or during complex data processing. For example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c']; // $value will be NULL, not an error
echo $value; // Outputs nothing
```

This silent failure can make debugging difficult. It is easy to miss and assume a different part of the code is the problem.  The null value might then propagate through the code and lead to further unexpected errors later on.
